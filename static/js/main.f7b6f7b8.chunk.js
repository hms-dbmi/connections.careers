She is currently a senior data scientist at BCG where she is working to transform healthcare.</hl>\n\n## From STEM to Informatics\nGrowing up, Lexi Signoriello was a STEM kid. In addition to being a voracious reader of mysteries and science books and loving the outdoors, she liked math, science (especially biology), and statistics. \n\nIn college, Lexi studied math, biology, and computer science. These interests led Lexi to curate a curriculum that included a biostatistics minor. She also took a course in algorithms, which involved using algorithms in biology. This was Lexi\u2019s first exposure to biostatistics and biomedial informatics, which she found extremely interesting.\n\nDuring college, Lexi participated in research that involved building computational models for disease spreading through a hospital. Unlike taking classes, where there is a right answer, with research, the exciting part is trying to find an answer. This experience ignited a passion in research. Researchers think independently, form questions, and conduct research to find answers.\n\nUpon graduating from college, Lexi didn\u2019t feel like she was done learning. She wanted to learn more about biology, computer science, coding, and statistics. She decided to pursue a master\u2019s and then a PhD at Yale in computational biology and bioinformatics. She liked that bioinformatics programs, including the program at Yale, tended to be connected to the medical and research fields. At Yale, she was frequently at the medical school and also spent a great deal of time in the lab, both of which she enjoyed. Lexi also spent time developing software, conducting molecular dynamics simulations, and even touching on genomics.  \n\nLexi\u2019s program at Yale had five women, who bonded, collaborated, supported each other, and made the entire experience more fun. She liked the flexibility of her program, as she was able to take courses in biology, computer science, informatics, and other areas of interest. She also discovered how broad the field of biomedical informatics is, including analyses in areas such as hospital electronic medical records, the human genome, and pathology.\n\n> \u201cThere are so many things that bioinformatics means . . . It is really an encompassing, huge field. It\u2019s not this one specific, very precise research field.\u201d\n\nDuring her master\u2019s and PhD programs, Lexi worked on cancer research, studying the shape of immune cells infiltrating melanoma tumors. She was also a TA and helped teach a bioinformatics class. As a result of her PhD experience, Lexi feels she became a better programer, a better researcher, and more of an independent thinker.\n    \n## Leveraging Biomedical Informatics Skills\nMentoring was important throughout Lexi\u2019s life. As a result, Lexi, was inspired to mentor others. During her program at Yale, each year she would serve as a mentor, helping one student with their senior thesis. She also mentored middle school girls, working with them on science experiments and encouraging them to consider science and to make their own path. In addition, Lexi taught coding classes to middle schoolers and was also a yoga instructor. \n\nAfter completing her PhD, Lexi joined the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) where she is working as a data scientist using informatics to transform the healthcare world. Since joining this consulting firm, every problem she has worked on has involved using medical informatics. She plans to continue working in this space, where she sees tremendous opportunities. \n\nAs the world quickly becomes digital, Lexi believes it is going to be necessary for everyone to have some informatics knowledge, as informatics will be everywhere. Lexi is happy with her own choices to develop extensive informatics knowledge and skills. She says that the ultimate reward is having significant impact, improving patients\u2019 quality of life, and making changes in the world.\n\n> \u201cThe most exciting aspect of informatics is being able to make an impact. The field of medicine is moving so quickly, and we hope is giving people more life and less pain. Informatics enables us to accelerate that, to get answers sooner, and to be able to make changes in the world.\u201d\n"},{name:"Cameron Coleman",img:i.p+"static/media/Cameron Coleman.1146e264.jpg",title:"MD, MPS",csTitle:"Cameron Coleman, Jr., MD, MPS",csYt:"9Jop1XS18dM",csBody:"\n<hl>Cameron Coleman is completing his residency in preventive medicine at the University of North Carolina Hospitals. He received a master\u2019s degree in biomedical and health informatics, which he is using to focus on quality improvement and population health.</hl>\n\n## Always on a pre-med path\nCameron Coleman grew up in a small, rural community in Virginia. After concluding that his childhood desire to drive an ice cream truck was probably not a sustainable career, he set his sights on healthcare. He had significant exposure to healthcare, as his father was a primary care doctor.   \n\nCameron liked most academic subjects, particularly math and science. In entering college at the University of Virgina, Cameron decided to pursue a pre-med track, taking courses in biology and chemisty, and majoring in human biology. His thesis involved studying supposed miracle treatments for obesity, which he concluded didn\u2019t work.\n\nOne summer during college Cameron became certified as an EMT. He rode with a rescue squad and saw care delivered on the front line, which was thrilling and reinforced his interest in healthcare. He also worked as a medical scribe at a healthcare facility. This institution had just implemented an electronic health record (EHR), which was a disaster. The institution had to bring in pre-med students to help clinicians with documentation. This experience exposed Cameron to the complexity of the healthcare system and the importance of technology, systems, and processes. Cameron believes this experience planted the seed for his interest in informatics.\n\nCameron took a year off after college to work as a full-time scribe in an emergency department. While this was a different healthcare facility than he worked at previously, he saw the same frustrations in adopting EHRs and saw the same need to optimize IT systems and improve processes. \n\n## Solving Big Problems\nCameron continued on to medical school at the University of Virginia. In med school he got involved in a research project focused on optimizing EHRs and making them easier to use. This was his first exposure to informatics.\n\nDuring his internship at the University of North Carolina Hospitals, Cameron was frustrated with the IT systems being used and the negative impact these systems had. His frustration caused him to reflect on how he might use his medical training to solve bigger, systemic problems.\n\n> \u201cI was asking myself what do I want to be working on in 5, 10, or 20 years? At the time, my answer was that individual patient care may not be what I want to be doing, but I may want to solve these bigger problems, a lot of which start with technology.\u201d  \n\nAt the end of his UNC internship, Cameron had an opportunity to spend a postdoc year doing research and taking courses in informatics, which resulted in pursuing a Master\u2019s in Biomedical and Health Informatics. Because he didn\u2019t have a technology or programming background, Cameron initially felt a bit overwhelmed. He focused on learning about computer programming, databases, and how EHRs work. Over time he grew comfortable with the language and tools of biomedical informatics.  \n\nCameron was excited about being able to do translational informatics in the real world, work on hospital quality improvement initiatives, and use skills he acquired, such as querying database systems to identify patients. \n\n## New Career Paths\n\nWhile at UNC, the director of the National Library of Medicine spoke at the institution. She said in the past, the pathway to a healthcare career was through clinical work. In the future, a career in healthcare will be through technical work. This perspective opened Cameron\u2019s eyes to possibilities gained through his skills and experiences. Cameron says his degree in biomedical informatics has \u201copened a lot of doors.\u201d\n\n> \u201cThere there is so much opportunity for people with both clinical training and informatics training to make clinical care systems work better.\u201d\n\nAs Cameron completes his residency in preventive medicine, he sees patients a few days each week, but is also thinking more broadly. He is focused on improving population health and working on hospital and outpatient quality improvement initiatives, and spends time with state and local health departments.\n\nCameron sees technology and informatics becoming more integrated with public and population health. As technology becomes better integrated, he believes it will become more intuitive and easier to use. It will make it easier and more fun for physicians like his father to practice medicine, which will ultimately improve patient care and population health. \n"},{name:"Casey Overby Taylor",img:i.p+"static/media/Casey Overby Taylor.5bb972b1.jpg",title:"PhD",csTitle:"Casey Overby Taylor, PhD, Assistant Professor, Johns Hopkins University",csYt:"cqRkz8CwMD8",csBody:"\n<hl>Casey studied bioinformatics in getting her bachelor\u2019s, master\u2019s, and PhD degrees as well as in a post doc. She is an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins where she is conducting research and teaching biomedical informatics.</hl>\n\nDiscovering Bioinformatics\nCasey Overby Taylor was born in Washington, DC, and grew up in East Lansing, Michigan, but moved a great deal as a child, going to five different elementary schools. She had many interests, ranging from the arts to entomology to engineering, computer science, and medicine. Since both of her parents had PhDs and were in academia, she had familiarity with education and research\u2014and considered this a possible career path.\n\nAt the University of Michigan, she initially took classes in the arts and sciences as well as biology and computer science. Based on her interests, her father\u2014who was in administration at Michigan State\u2014suggested she explore the emerging field of bioinformatics, as he thought it would be a good fit for her. When Casey discovered that bioinformatics included the Human Genome Project, her interest was sparked in learning more. \n\nThe University of Michigan, which had just launched a graduate program in bioinformatics, didn\u2019t yet have undergraduate offerings in bioinformatics, but allowed Casey to create her own bioinformatics major, which involved working with some graduate faculty. Once immersed in bioinformatics, Casey saw that the field was far broader than just the human genome. She was exposed to NCBI resources, PubMed, and other types of relevant data, information, and resources.\n\nIn preparing to graduate from college, Casey was unsure of her next step. She was thinking medical school or a PhD program, but didn\u2019t feel ready to commit to either. So, she decided on a master\u2019s program at the University of Pennsylvania specializing in bioinformatics. While at Penn she worked as a research assistant, which provided exposure to clinical research, software development, and creating tools for researchers. During the course of this work, a faculty member suggested to Casey that she apply to PhD programs in bioinformatics.\n\nCasey followed this advice and applied to a range of PhD programs. She ended up choosing the University of Washington, which included both bioinformatics and clinical informatics. \n\nBefore beginning her PhD, Casey participated in a program called BBSI (Bioengineering and Bioinformatics Summer Institute) at the University of Pittsburgh. As part of this program, she worked in a lab and used modeling. This experience confirmed to Casey that a PhD was the way to go and made her even more excited about her direction.\n\n\n\n## PhD and Beyond\n\nAt the University of Washington, which was an NLM training program, Casey received a PhD in Biomedical and Health Informatics as well as a graduate certificate in public health genetics. She saw her exposure to clinical informatics as eye opening, learning about electronic health records, tools for clinical research, and how clinicians use technology when treating patients. Other learning included exposure to genetics in public health, which caused Casey to think more about the ethical, legal, and social issues related to genetics. \n\nAn important experience during her PhD program was spending a summer at NLM where she did work to understand how well genetics are captured in abstracts and learned about all of NLM\u2019s tools.\n\nAs she completed her PhD, Casey decided to spend a year doing a post doc at Columbia, looking at questions around how genetics is included in decision support. She concluded that she wanted to remain in academia and continue doing research. She loves the research process of coming up with questions, investigating, and overcoming barriers. She also enjoys teaching and training students.\n\nCasey is currently an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University. Her research spans a number of areas at the intersection of biomedical informatics and public health, and continues to look at decision support. Most rewarding to Casey is applying findings from her research in ways that help patients in the real world. \n\n> \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily help people directly . . . but, I think that through decision support, I can directly impact patient care by making sure the right information is received by the right person at the right time to be able to provide care.\u201d\n"},{name:"Chase Parsons",img:i.p+"static/media/Chase Parsons.b15e7ce3.jpg",title:"DO, MBI, FAAP",csTitle:"Chase R. Parsons, DO, MBI, FAAP",csYt:"cnvqiDKrUys",csBody:"\n<hl>Currently working at Boston\u2019s Children\u2019s Hospital, Chase Parsons splits his time as a pediatric hospitalist, where he sees patients, and as a physician lead for Informatics Prescriber Education and Clinical Decision Support, where he works on projects using clinical informatics to improve quality and safety.\n\n## Chase\u2019s Informatics Journey\n\nAs far back as Chase can recall, he was interested in technology. He loved video games and editing digital video. In thinking about a possible career, he always envisioned being a doctor, specifically a family physician. He saw a family doctor as providing an ideal combination of science, technology, and interacting with people.\n\nHis interest in science led him to study molecular biology in college as part of a pre-med track. Following graduation from Grove City College in 2008 with a Bachelor of Science, Chase attended the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine, graduating in 2012 as a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine.\n\nChase continued his training with a pediatrics residency at Geisinger Health System from 2012 through 2016. It was during this residency that Chase first learned about biomedical informatics. As Geisinger, biomedical informatics was beginning to be used as part of quality initiatives and as part of process measures. Chase saw the potential for the use of data in healthcare to make more informed decisions that could improve patient care.\n\nThis exposure to informatics made Chase want to learn more, as the practical application of biomedical informatics matched his interests of technology and patient care. This caused Chase to look into clinical informatics fellowships across the country, end up at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital and as part of the Masters program in Biomedical Informatics (MBI) at Harvard Medical School.\n\nWhen imagining the biomedical informatics program at HMS, Chase was excited about interacting with others who were equally excited about both caring for patients and having a positive impact on the entire healthcare system.\n\nImportant memories from his biomedical informatics program include: participating in a sort of boot camp on basics, which included learning to program in R, a statistical programming language that is unfamiliar to most doctors; wrestling with problems such as how to get patient data into electronic health records; learning how to work with large data sets; and developing expertise in data visualization.\n\nIn addition, Chase feels that he gained broad exposure to healthcare beyond just its clinical aspects, including policy and business aspects. As a result of completing his fellowship and MBI program in 2018, Chase now feels \u201cinformatics informed\u201d in that he is comfortable and confident in using data to solve important problems. \n\n> \u201cI have a unique set of knowledge that most people across the country or world don\u2019t have.\u201d\n\n## Using Informatics for Impact\n\nUpon completing his fellowship and Masters in Biomedical Informatics, Chase became an Instructor of Pediatrics at Harvard Medical School and Physician Lead for Informatics Prescriber Education and Clinical Decision Support at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital, where he is today.\n\nAs a practicing physician, Chase continues to make rounds where he sees patients each day, speaks with them, and develops relationships. \n\nBut his expertise in biomedical informatics allows him to work as part of a team that is developing and disseminating practice guidelines to improve how care is delivered. Chase\u2019s team is using data to prevent alert overload for clinicians and is optimizing processes within the hospital\u2019s electronic health record to improve the patient discharge process. In this way, informatics enables Chase to have a broader impact on the healthcare system and on patient care. \n\nIn particular, Chase\u2019s research interests are patient confidentiality and how pediatric patients interact with their own health data in the electronic health record.\n\nChase recounted that \u201cThe most rewarding thing is when I am part of a team that makes a change that affects either our patients or doctors . . . and I hear that people are happy with the change and say, \u2018It\u2019s easier for me to take care of my patients now\u2019 or \u2018I gave my patient the right antibiotic the other day because of that app that your team helped deploy across the hospital. That\u2019s the most rewarding thing that\u2019s happened so far.\u201d\n\n> \u201cWhat makes me most excited is that the work I do will directly affect both patients and clinicians . . . to think that you\u2019re touching patients, not just the ones that you\u2019re seeing, but touching patients that your colleagues are seeing in another location. I think that\u2019s really cool.\u201d\n"},{name:"Jonathan Lustgarten",img:i.p+"static/media/Jonathan Lustgarten.93dc3509.jpg",title:"MS, PhD, VMD",csTitle:"Jonathan Lustgarten, PhD, Doctor of Veterinary Medicine; Senior Biomedical Informatics Specialist, VCA, Inc.",csBody:"\n<hl>Jonathan Lustgarten got a master\u2019s in bioinformatics and a PhD in biomedical informatics, before proceeding to achieve his lifelong dream of becoming a veterinarian. He is currently using his bioinformatics training in working as senior biomedical informatics specialist at one of the country\u2019s largest veterinary hospital companies.</hl>\n\n## Dreaming of Becoming a Vet\nBorn in North Bergen County, New Jersey, Jonathan Lustgarten had many interests. He loved sports, animals, the outdoors, geology, paleontology, and computers. He grew up wanting to become a veterinarian and as a child even did research on endangered species.\n\nIn high school, Jonathan was fascinated by biology and computers, and was first exposed to biomedical informatics. An advisor suggested that he consider Carnegie Mellon Univeristy (CMU), where he could continue studying biology and computers. At CMU, Jonathan majored in computational biology and minored in bio-organic chemistry, preparing himself for veterinary school.  \n\nIn contemplating his post-college plans, Jonathan explored applying to veterinary schools. He found that the acceptance rate of undergrads was only about 2%. He also found that applicants to vet school with a master\u2019s or a PhD had more than a 30% acceptance rate.\n\nBased on his interest in informatics and to increase chances of getting into veterinary school, Jonathan decided to get a master\u2019s in bioinformatics at the University of Pittsburgh, followed by a PhD in biomedical informatics. Jonathan\u2019s desire for further education in biomedical informatics was driven by his deep interest in data and by the interdisciplinary nature of biomedical informatics. \n\n> \u201cI realized that biomedical informatics was a giant sandbox; it was all these different areas coming together. That is something I love.\u201d\n\nWhile at Pitt, Jonathan came to realize the breadth of biomedical informatics. He was focused on machine learning, artificial intelligence, the application of biomedical data, and informatics extraction. His thesis involved working with a professor on ALS research, developing an algorithm to predict ALS in the same family. This algorithm enabled predicting ALS, in some instances, earlier than clinical science.\n\nUpon completing his PhD, Jonathan applied to veterinary school. Ironically, based on his PhD and expertise in biomedical informatics, he had offers to teach at multiple veterinary schools, including some that didn\u2019t accept him as a student. He was firm in not wanting to teach at a vet school, but wanting to become a vet. He was ultimately accepted to veterinary school at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\n\n\n## Taking Biomedical Informatics to Veterinary Medicine  \nBeginning veterinary school with a master\u2019s and PhD in bioinformatics provided Jonathan with a unique perspective. He was attuned to the massive amount of data being generated, but not being analyzed or used. Jonathan was excited about being able to access data in veterinary medicine, derive value from this data, provide better care for animals, and improve the operations of veterinary hospitals.\n\n> \u201cAs I went through [veterinary school] I started realizing that the massive wealth of data that veterinary medicine was generating really had no one to work on it.\u201d\n\nUpon completing veterinary school, Jonathan worked as a practicing vet, which he has continued to do on a part-time basis. He also worked as director of veterinary informatics for a group of pet hospitals, and is current senior biomedical informatics specialist at VCA, which is owned by Mars Pet Health. Mars owns about 10% of all veterinary hospitals in the US, and created this informatics job specifically for Jonathan. \n\nVCA\u2019s goal is to empower Jonathan to improve the organization\u2019s electronic medical record and use data to make veterinarians more efficient, reduce vets\u2019 workload, and conduct research.\n\n> \u201cWe\u2019re crafting a new vision for what the electronic medical record can be. . . . Ideally, everything I\u2019m doing will affect the clinician.\u201d\n\nAn example of the power of an integrated electronic medical record occurred when some dogs appeared to become sick after consuming contamined dog treats made by a company in China. Using the electronic system, Jonathan conducted data mining to look across VCA to see dogs that appeared to have been diagnosed with a specific syndrome. Using this information, it was possible to go back to dog owners to ask, \u201cWhat treats are you feeding your dog?\u201d This quickly confirmed that the treats were to blame. Vets could then treat these dogs and could warn other pet owners not to feed their dogs these contaminated treats.\n\nAs the amount of data continues to grow, Jonathan feels the need will grow in veterinary medicine for more people with informatics tools and expertise. He encouraged those interested in informatics to not shy away from the veterinary world, but to look for organizations that are open to the idea of using informatics.\n\n",csYt:"unJa5u7hZbs"},{name:"Kimberly Shoenbill",img:i.p+"static/media/Kimberly Shoenbill.8186962f.jpg",title:"MD, PhD, MS",csBody:"\n<hl>After years as a practicing physician, Kimberly (Kim) Shoenbill became interested in using data to improve healthcare. She worked to create a master\u2019s program in biomedical informatics and went on to get a PhD. She is now a physician, informatician, researcher, and teacher.  </hl>\n\n## Making Lives Better\nGrowing up in Kenosha, Wisconsin, Kim Shoenbill enjoyed learning about science, biology, and how the human body worked. She was always a great listener and wanted to be in a helping profession.\n\nKim was the sixth of seven children, but was the first child in her family to go to college and undertook the process largely alone. She put herself through Marquette University, where she majored in psychology and took the pre-med prerequisites. During college she was a resident advisor and worked at a hospital on the med-surg floor. \n\nAs she completed college, Kim was wavering between pursuing psychology and medicine. She took a year off to earn some money. During that year, she decided that while counselling was appealing, medicine provided the ability to treat the whole person. \n\nKim proceeded to medical school at the University of Wisconsin (UW), which has a strong primary care focus. As a med student, she had a foray into research, assisting a professor studying amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) by analyzing data. Kim said, \u201cWe were using data to do informatics before it was called informatics.\u201d She learned that both clinical care and research are team sports.\n\nAfter graduating from medical school, Kim practiced family medicine for several years. She enjoyed developing relationships with patients and had a philosophy of always seeing the potential in every person and situation. \n\nTransitioning to Biomedical Informatics\n\nIn working at a clinic and treating patients over time, Kim would start to see patterns and observe correlations. But she was so busy seeing patients, there was never time to analyze these patterns, nor did she have the tools to do so. Yet her interest lingered, and Kim wanted to learn more about data and informatics in improving care.\n\nAt the same time, Kim became interested in electronic health records (EHRs). She saw the potential of EHRs as well as shortcomings. She also saw the potential for the massive amounts of data collected in EHRs, most of which wasn\u2019t used.\n\nFor a birthday present, Kim asked her husband for an expensive informatics textbook, which he bought for her. She read it cover to cover, which further fueled her interest in data and informatics. She realized the importance of aggregating data, understanding the data, and getting useful information from data. She saw the potential of using knowledge to improve patient care by developing guidelines and metrics. \n\n> \u201cData can lead to knowledge. From knowledge, you can start changing how you treat patients.\u201d\n\nThis led Kim to initially seek additional training and eventually led her to a master\u2019s degree, an NLM (National Library of Medicine) Fellowship, certification in clinical informatics, and a PhD. But her path wasn\u2019t straightforward. \n\nAt the time, UW didn\u2019t offer a master\u2019s degree in biomedical informatics. Kim identified pockets of the training she wanted in various departments. Eventually, the administration asked her to help build the program. She began in the clinical investigation program and learned about data, statistics, research skills, clinical trials, and more. What Kim did for her master\u2019s is now UW\u2019s master\u2019s program, and what she did for her PhD became the template for the PhD program.  \n\nDuring her PhD, Kim looked at lifestyle modification in treating hypertension. She used AI, specifically natural language processing, to review text in patients\u2019 records to see if a doctor had discussed lifestyle modification. She could see if a physician had written a note in the EHR about counseling a patient on lifestyle modification, such as exercise.\n\nUsing AI, she reviewed over 800,000 charts for 15,000 patients. She found documentation about lifestyle modification for 78% of patients, but also found that physicians had followed up with only about 5% of patients. Kim is now working to create systemic solutions to make it easier for physicians to document and follow up with patients about lifestyle modification. She is also looking at benchmarks and metrics.\n\n## Broader Scope\n\nKim has now moved to the University of North Carolina School of Medicine where she is an assistant professor in family medicine and a faculty member of the Program of Health and Clinical Informatics. She still sees patients, but is now doing more research and teaching. UNC recently established a clinical informatics fellowship, which will further increase her focus on teaching and training. \n\nIn reflecting on her journey, Kim recounts, \u201cI went into medicine to help people. This [biomedical informatics] is a wonderful way to help people out at a higher level, that is more far reaching.\u201d She enjoys using information to inform how she treats patients at the point of care, while also using data to inform doctors and patients more broadly.\n\n> \u201cIf you went into medicine to help patients, this is a way you can have a broader, more far-reaching scope to reach patients and help them.\u201d\n",csTitle:"Kimberly Shoenbill, MD, PhD, MS, Assistant Professor, University of North Carolina School of Medicine",csYt:"Jjih86zVemU"},{name:"Lance Pflieger",img:i.p+"static/media/Lance Pflieger.5009e65d.jpg",title:"PhD",csBody:"\n<hl>Lance Pflieger, after completing his PhD in biomedical informatics at the University of Utah, became a staff scientist at City of Hope where he is working on complex cancer research.

As a lover of science, he had a passion for learning about evolution and looking at the stars. He imagined he might become an astronomer or an astronaut or more practically, perhaps a high school teacher.\n\nLance decided to attend Utah State University where he studied biology and took pre-med courses, to preserve the option to go into medicine. As an undergrad, Lance was part of a research program where he got to spend time in a lab, which transformed him. He decided he didn\u2019t want to be a clinician and preferred becoming a scientist. \n\nDuring a subsequent stint working as a lab tech, Lance was exposed to bioinformatics, which sat at the intersection of two passions: biology and computer science. This field spoke to him and he concluded, \u201cThat\u2019s where I want to be.\u201d He proceed to look into graduate programs and decided to pursue a PhD in biomedical informatics at the University of Utah. \n\nLance discovered that the biomedical informatics program at the University of Utah was one of the oldest and best programs in the country.

He said he felt like a kid in a candy store, overwhelmed by the challenge of where to focus. He was able to do work in cancer research, in neurology research, and in predictive modeling related to pharmacology. He found the breadth of his experience as astounding. Ultimately, he focused his research on uncertainty quantification and reproducability in next-generation sequencing.\n\n## Endless Possibilities\n\nWhile the numerous possibilities in his PhD program made it difficult to narrow his focus, Lance faced a similar challenge related to deciding what to do upon completing his PhD He wasn\u2019t sure if he wanted to work in industry or pursue an academic career.

The problem he is working on is a translational problem. His computational work could be put into a clinical trial within a few years. \n\nIn addition to the complexity of the work, what Lance finds most rewarding is the impact this work will have on patients, and the caliber of people he gets to work with each day, including clinicians, PIs, and other scientists.\n\n> \u201cWhat\u2019s most rewarding is that I can transform patients\u2019 lives. That\u2019s what brought me into this field. . . it\u2019s nice to actually know that you\u2019re impacting patient care. . . . What I like to know is this is going to help somebody, maybe not tomorrow, but down the road. What I\u2019m doing will be impactful.\u201d\n\nAt some point down the road, after writing a few high-impact papers, the project at City of Hope will eventually wrap up. When that occurs, Lance is hoping to spend a bit of time in industry before settling down in academia. He sees the robust demand for bioinformaticians and the numerous opportunities available as one of the most exciting parts of the field.\n\n> \u201cOne of the nice things about biomedical informatics is you\u2019re not nailed down. You can jump to industry, you can jump to academia. You can maybe even find a place that bridges both. . . . I won\u2019t have any problem finding a job. That\u2019s the great thing about biomedical informatics; it\u2019s a very desired career.\u201d   \n\nIn reflecting on his journey, Lance is astounded at how far he\u2019s come. From his small town in Utah to working on groundbreaking research at a world-renowned cancer center is not where he expected to be. \n\nLooking forward, based on his education and experience, and the development of the entire biomedical informatics industry, Lance is uncertain about the future but excited about the possibilities.   \n",csTitle:"Lance Pflieger, PhD, Staff Scientist, City of Hope, Comprehensive Cancer Institute",csYt:"kCG7kK8RKXo"},{name:"Laura Anderson",img:i.p+"static/media/Laura Anderson.30c60c31.jpg",title:"PhD",csBody:"\n<hl>Already a junior faculty member in a tenure-track faculty position, Laura Anderson had a short-term faculty fellowship in biomedical informatics. The knowledge and skills she gained will help better analyze data, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes.</hl>\n\n## Inspired to Help Others\n\nBorn and raised in the small town of Salamanca, New York\u2014the only US city on an American Indian reservation\u2014Laura Anderson saw extensive health problems, mental health issues, and addiction. Even at a young age, she was inspired to help others.\n\nAfter considering studying vocal performance and a career as a singer, Laura was drawn to take psychology courses. Resonating most was the subject of clinical health psychology. Laura ended up graduating with degrees in psychology and Spanish from the State University of New York (SUNY) at Geneseo. She immediately put her education to use as a bilingual family therapist.\n\nLaura decided to continue her education, receiving a PhD in counseling and school psychology. While a graduate student, she was a teaching assistant for a statistics class. Upon completing her PhD, Laura worked as a bilingual school psychologist. During this time she became interested in promoting health and healthy weight within schools. She subsequently did a postdoc fellowship focused on clinical health psychology. \n\nToday, Laura is an assistant professor at the University at Buffalo School of Nursing. As a non-nurse in the school of nursing, she is not accredited to teach nursing-related courses, but teaches in areas such as research methods and statistics. \n\nHer main focus is a multi-component, non-diet intervention she has developed to promote weight loss and healthy weight. It involves dietary changes without feeling restricted and incorporates mental health, coping skills, and stress management. Participants keep daily diaries and track activity with devices such as Fitbits.\n\nIn addition, Laura sees patients in private practice. These are mainly patients struggling with obesity who are considering or have had bariatic surgery.\n\n## Mid-career Immersion in Bioinformatics\n\nLaura summarized her situation as follows: a junior faculty member in a tenure-track position with a PhD, a post doc, a license as a psychologist, and certification as a school psychologist. She is doing what she loves and loves what she is doing.\n\nBut because she wanted to be even better at her job and more competitive, she decided to enhance her skill set through a fellowship in biomedical informatics. \n\nFor years Laura had been collecting data about the multi-component intervention she had developed. Patients would provide data at multiple points each day about their diet, activity, coping skills, and more. The amount of data created was enormous. But, while basic analysis had occurred, Laura and her team were unable to mine the data and look at patterns or trends. Also, Laura had not tapped into the data within electronic health records to learn even more.\n\nWith the blessing of her dean and department chair, during an eight-week faculty fellowship Laura spent each day in the Department of Biomedical Informatics at the University at Buffalo. She learned about electronic health records, explored data on bariatric surgery patients, and learned about tools such as natural language processing. In completing this fellowship, Laura had identified new research questions to probe and gained new skills to use in analyzing data.\n\nFor example, Laura sees the potential to use informatics to better understand which components of her intervention are most valuable and work best with specific patients. This will allow personalizing the intervention and improving outcomes.\n\n> \u201cI wanted real-world data to inform our interventions, to ultimately help with precision or personalized interventions. . . the NIH literature, physicians, and psychologists all say multi-component personalized interventions for healthy weight management. How do you develop those unless you have some real-world data to inform it?\u201d\n\nAs a mid-career professional, knowing that data is permeating every aspect of healthcare, Laura believes it is essential to constantly acquire new skills in deriving insights from this data. She has encouraged colleagues from nursing and public health to pursue similar fellowships.\n\nWhile Laura has no plans to become an informaticist\u2014she is quite happy as a psychologist\u2014she has made informatics part of who she is and how she does her work.  \n",csTitle:"Laura Anderson, PhD, Assistant Professor, University of Buffalo School of Nursing, Licensed Psychologist, Director of PULSE Healthy Weight Research Team",csYt:"f8rQb5haoYE"},{name:"Maureen Hillenmeyer",img:i.p+"static/media/Maureen Hillenmeyer.1054ba4d.jpg",title:"PhD",csBody:"\n<hl>After getting her PhD in biomedical informatics and spending years conducting research, Maureen Hillenmeyer co-founded Hexagon Bio, raised venture capital, and is working to build a next-generation drug company.</hl>\n\n## A Passion for Research\n\nRaised in a suburb of Indianpolis, Indiana, Maureen Hillenmeyer was interested in science and technology at a young age, due in part to her parents being focused on computers. Maureen recalls being fascinated by biology, going to NASA\u2019s space camp, and thinking about becoming a doctor.  \n\nRecruited to the University of Notre Dame as a competitive swimmer, Maureen majored in biology and took classes in computer science. With the human genome project underway and bioinformatics flourishing, Maureen was interested in the connection between biology and computers. She also had the opportunity to participate in undergraduate research in a lab at Notre Dame. She did basic programming to analyze large amounts of DNA sequencing data.\n\nMaureen\u2019s lab experience steered her away from medicine and toward research. After graduating from college, she worked for a year in a lab as a research assistant. During that year she confirmed her interest in research and decided to apply to PhD programs. Reasons for pursuing a PhD included being able to do her own research and learn more about genetics, and that it is a prerequisite for many biotech jobs. \n\nAfter considering several PhD programs, Maureen chose Stanford. She liked the location, the faculty, the students, the integration of biology and informatics, and the combination of bioinformatics and medical informatics. She was also interested in training in yeast genetics, which is unique and important. She sought out a university and a lab with expertise in yeast genetics; Stanford met these criteria.\n\nWhile equipped with a solid biology background, in getting her PhD, Maureen found it necessary to go deeper in computer science, chemistry, statistics, and biomedical informatics.  \n\nMaureen\u2019s PhD research involved screening large numbers of drugs against different yeast strains. She sifted through a large dataset and developed algorithms to predict the mechanisms of these drugs and to apply learnings to human cells. The result of that project was impactful and it is becoming possible to do work in human cells.\n\n## Creating a Next-Gen Drug Company\n\nWhile pursuing her PhD, Maureen was exposed to the entrepreneurial environment at and around Stanford. She got to know countless numbers of people starting companies, and the lab she worked in was extremely entrepreneurial. The general environment around Stanford was that commercialization was good for science and was a critical way to translate discoveries to patients more quickly. This led Maureen to take an \u201cMBA 101\u201d course to learn about starting a company.   \n\nAfter completing her PhD, Maureen stayed at Stanford as a postdoc working in a lab focused on the discovery and engineering of natural products. Natural products are drugs from nature, which includes drug like penicillin and statins. These are drugs found in microbes and plants around the world. \n\nHistorically, natural product drugs have been discovered by accident or brute force. But Maureen thought it was possible to improve the process for discovering natural drugs by adding computation to the equation. She downloaded all publicly available genome sequences of microbes from around the world\u2014and was blown away by the number of genomes or sequences that were encoding natural drugs that no one had studied. By using computation it is possible to sift through hundreds of thousands of genomes to pinpoint and priortize the ones that are encoding drugs relevant to human patients. These efforts have led to breakthroughs on the experimental and computation side.\n\nBased on this learning, Maureen could see a clear path to commercialization. As a result, she participated in co-founding Hexagon Bio as a private company to commercialize these research ideas. She has raised $20 million in venture capital for Hexagon, which has 24 employees. Maureen is spending her time as a scientist-CEO focusing on science, management, and fundraising; looking ahead to preclinical and eventually clinical work; and starting to talk to potential partners about commercialization.\n\nMaureen sees huge potential for Hexagon to grow into a unique, next-generation, data science-driven drug company that takes a very different approach to drug development compared to traditional biotech and drug companies.\n\nIn reflecting on her journey, Maureen has enjoyed being at the intersection of multiple fields and feels satisfaction in using research to have a major impact on the world. She sees great value in her PhD, in her biomedical informatics knowledge, and in the network she has built along the way.\n\n> \u201cI knew I wanted to do something in biomedicine, something research related, and something that would have a big impact on the world.\u201d\n",csTitle:"Maureen Hillenmeyer, PhD, CEO, Hexagon Bio",csYt:"iJc06hjUWyE"},{name:"Nate Apathy",img:i.p+"static/media/Nate Apathy.7799eedb.jpg",title:"PhD Student",csBody:"\n<hl>With plans to receive his PhD in 2020, Nate Apathy hopes to pursue a career in academia. His passions are using population health informatics to improve public health and determining the most appropriate regulatory structures to benefit society. Nate\u2019s research interests are around health information exchange and interoperability.  </hl>\n\n## Producing Tangible Output\n\nSince he first worked on his high school newspaper, Nate has been motivated to produce something with a tangible output. He has since sought projects and work where he is involved in creating something tangible that has meaningful impact.\n\nIn college, Nate was fascinated by and majored in economics, with an interest in the behavioral and cognitive factors that affect how people make decisions. His junior and senior years, Nate worked on a project that involved writing business plans for biotech startups. This was his initial exposure to healthcare and led him to realize, \u201cI want to be in healthcare or some health-related field.\u201d\n\nAfter graduation, Nate combined his longtime interest in a tangible output and his newfound interest in healthcare and went to work for Cerner, one of the world\u2019s leading EHR companies. As an economics major, he initially felt overwhelmed in this technology environment. But the training and the collaborative culture led him to conclude, \u201cI can do this.\u201d He learned about relational databases, gained an introduction to informatics, and built software systems used in hospitals. He found it gratifying when he saw someone in a hospital using a system he had helped build.\n\n## Informatics for Population and Public Health\n\nDuring Nate\u2019s time at Cerner, meaningful use regulations were impacting all health systems and provider practices, driving the widespread adoption of electronic health records. However, Nate observed firsthand that some of the regulatory requirements that were imposed made physicians do a great deal of work that wasn\u2019t directly related to better patient care or outcomes.\n\nThis experience led Nate to decide to go back to school to learn more about regulation, policy, and informatics. Nate chose the Public & Population Health Informatics program at the Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health at Indiana University. This was a rare informatics program within a school of public health. Nate began this program in 2016 and expects to receive his PhD in Health Policy and Management in 2020.\n\nIU\u2019s unique program combines a focus on innovative informatics work with a concentration on regulation and policy. The program is situated in the middle of multiple healthcare systems, including a children\u2019s hospital, a public safety net hospital, a VA hospital, a university hospital, and a cancer center.   \n\nThe emphasis of the program is using public and population health informatics to improve public health. The program provides a robust data infrastructure, expert mentors, and flexibility to come up with ideas, engage in creative conversations, and conduct research. \n\n> \u201cThe IU program sits at the intersection of classic sort of health policy and management, or epidemiological research and training, and informatics applications. You get to apply informatics to epidemiological problems; you get to apply informatics to health policy and management problems.\u201d\n\nNate\u2019s research interests are largely around health information exchange and interoperability. He looks at what types of incentives and regulations will get providers and health systems to exchange data so that physicians will have complete information when caring for patients. Nate has also participated in hackathons (including one in Israel) and has worked on projects to use informatics to develop solutions for clinicians at the point of care. \n\n> \u201cBeing able to build a flexible system that prioritizes information that gets exchanged so clinicians can have the most important information at their fingertips at the point of care, that is a question I could work on for 10 years.\u201d\n\nNate\u2019s perspective is that the field of informatics benefits from having people with a broad diversity of backgrounds and approaches, including healthcare experts, engineers, and technologists, as well as economics majors like Nate. While Nate initially asked questions such as \u201cWhat is DNA?\u201d his experience has convinced him that everything can be learned.\n\nNate sees the fields of healthcare and informatics as collaborative environments. These fields at this moment in time are an exciting place to work with people and data on population health and regulatory questions that have the potential to dramatically improve public health.\n",csTitle:"Nate Apathy, PhD Student, Indiana University",csYt:"2W2GpOHy37Y"},{name:"Peter Embi",img:i.p+"static/media/Peter Embi.f7c20f7b.jpg",title:"MD, MS, FACP, FACMI, FAMIA",csBody:"\n<hl>Peter Embi currently leads the Regenstrief Institute. He is an internationally recognized researcher, physician, educator, and leader in the field of clinical and translational research informatics.  </hl>\n\n## The Intersection of Healthcare and Computers  \n\nBorn in Miami to Cuban immigrants, Peter Embi comes from a long line of healthcare professionals. Peter followed suit with an affinity for science and a desire to be a doctor which began in childhood, when Peter dressed up as a doctor for Halloween.  \n\nIn college at the University of Florida, Peter majored in microbiology and cell science on a pre-med track. He continued on to medical school at the University of South Florida.\n\nAfter his first year of medical school Peter bought his first computer. He spent his summer learning about the World Wide Web and teaching himself to code websites. Upon returning to medical school he learned about an elective called \u201cmedical informatics\u201d that opened his eyes to the intersection of computers and healthcare. Also during this time, Peter became interested in the use of early handheld devices in healthcare, like the Apple Newton.\n\n> \u201cI thought, \u2018Wow. There\u2019s a field at this intersection of computers and healthcare. That\u2019s kind of cool.\u2019\u201d\n\nAt this point, Peter was completely focused on medical training, not informatics. Yet, as he explored residencies in internal medicine, he hoped to find a residency program with a medical informatics program. It turns out, he did his residency at Oregon Health Sciences, which also had informatics.\n\nDuring his residency, Peter interacted with the informatics group and worked on projects using technology to improve medical education. In taking on his chief residency, Peter wanted to do even more in informatics. He enrolled in a fellowship and a master\u2019s program in medical informatics. His thesis, which he worked on as electronic health records (EHRs) were being adopted, was about the transition from paper-based documents to computer-based records. \n\nThroughout this fellowship and master\u2019s, Peter developed knowledge in areas such as biostatistics and epidemiology, computer science, programming, and database design. It was also his first exposure to organizational behavior and change management.\n\n## Practicing Medicine and Dabbling in Informatics \n\nUpon completing his program in Oregon, Peter went on to a fellowship in rheumatology and immunology at the Clevelend Clinic. Looking back, Peter said, \u201cI was going to be a rheumatologist who had this niche in informatics rather than the way it turned out.\u201d\n\n## Transforming the Field\n\nWhen Peter joined the Cleveland Clinic, the organization was deploying its first EHR. Peter\u2019s primary focus was in rheumatology and immunology, but he was also interested in studying use of EHRs to improve research. At the time there was little research on EHRs and decision support to improve research decision making. Peter proceeded to conduct research in this area, now called clinical research informatics, and wrote some of the definitional papers establishing this as a sub-discipline.\n\nWith a passion for teaching and research, Peter decided to stay in academia. His first faculty position was at the University of Cincinnati (UC) as a rheumatologist while continuing work on using EHRs to enhance research. During his six years at UC he also developed a business plan that led to the establishment of a Center for Health Informatics.   \n\nPeter\u2019s next step took him to Ohio State University (OSU) as vice chair of the Department of Biomedical Informatics. While at OSU, Peter had the idea of a new position at the intersection of healthcare systems and research\u2014the chief research information officer (CRIO). He sold this idea interally and was the first person in the country to serve as a CRIO, an idea that has grown nationally.\n\nIn 2016, Peter was selected as president and CEO of the Regenstrief Institute. Regenstrief is legendary because of its innovations and impact. It is known for its Center for Biomedical Informatics, as well as strengths in health services research and aging research. Regenstrief is unique as an institute with health services researchers, informaticians, implementation scientists, and experts in domains such as aging and brain health.\n\n> \u201cWhat I find most rewarding is the ability to have an impact that could lead to substantial and sustained changes in a health system that needs to be improved.\u201d\n\nFrom his current perspective Peter sees tremendous opportunities for physician informaticians to have vibrant careers with significant impact. And because informatics is so interdisciplinary, practitioners who are not clinicians can also have enormous impact.\n\nPeter advises students pursuing informatics to take every opportunity to learn and explore in disciplines such as computer science, data science, biostatistics, and epidemiology. He also suggests gaining experience in healthcare by volunteering or finding an opportunity to shadow someone.\n\nGoing forward, as bioinformatics matures, Peter sees informatics leading to a learning healthcare system. Constant feedback loops will drive improvements in quality and efficiency.\n",csTitle:"Peter Embi, MD, President & CEO, Regenstrief Institute, Vice President for Learning Health Systems, IU Health",csYt:"GgqC75tN3HI"},{name:"Rimma Perotte",img:i.p+"static/media/Rimma Perotte.666dae5e.jpg",title:"PhD",csBody:"\n<hl>Rimma Perotte believes informatics can transform hospitals and healthcare. After getting a PhD in biomedical informatics at Columbia University, where her research focused on mining the data from electronic medical records, she is now putting her informatics skills into practice at New York-Presbyterian Hospital.    </hl>\n\n## Seeking a Meaningful, Nonclinical Role in Healthcare\n\nAs a child, Rimma Perotte loved math and science and felt it was cool to be smart in school. She also loved going to the doctor where clinicians asked, \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d and helped people feel better. These interests caused Rimma to consider a career in medicine, but she didn\u2019t see being a clinician as a good fit. She decided to study math and biology while in college at Northeastern University to see where that took her.\n\nPart of the student experience at Northeastern involves internships. Seeking internships that combined her interests in math and biology, as well as computer science, she interned in a genetics lab (which she liked), a chemistry lab (which wasn\u2019t for her), and at the Center for Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School (CBMI), which exposed her to the world of bioinformatics.\n\nWhile at CBMI, Rimma became fascinated by the emerging field of biomedical informatics. She saw this as a potential non-clinicinal career in healthcare where she could use her skills in math and computer science to make a difference. She also realized that with health systems and providers adopting electronic health records (EHRs), the amount of data was starting to explode. She heard a great deal of conversation such as, \u201cWe\u2019re getting more and more data, but we have no idea what to do with it.\u201d\n\nDuring her time at CBMI Rimma sensed tremendous enthusiasm for biomedical informatics. It didn\u2019t feel like a stodgy academic environment. Surrounded by smart, interesting, passionate PhDs, Rimma felt that proceeding to get a master\u2019s and a PhD in biomedical informatics seemed like the obvious next step.\n\nCBMI\u2019s Director Zak Kohane suggested that Rimma apply to Columbia University, which was known for doing analysis of electronic health record data. Despite not wanting to be in New York City, Rimma loved everything about the Biomedical Informatics Department at Columbia. She want straight from Northeastern to Columbia, where she received her master\u2019s in 2012 and PhD in 2016.\n\nAt Columbia, Rimma\u2019s focus was mining data from EHRs. She worked on ways to combine EHR data with other types of healthcare data to create a holistic view of a patient.\n\n## Getting Close to the Patient\n\nUpon completing her PhD, Rimma saw numerous career paths for bioinformaticists. She could have stayed in academia and become a professor, or could work at a hospital, join a startup, or go to a company such as Google or Apple. \n \nAs her next step, Rimma chose to join the staff of New York-Presbyterian Hospital where she is a program director for research science. She saw this position as an exciting opportunity to participate in projects that could have a direct, positive impact on patients.\n\nRimma has been involved in starting a new group at the hospital doing research and evaluation. Hospitals, which are working to transform healthcare, frequently conduct pilots. These pilots need to be carefully evaluated in a rigorous way, which requires the skills of informaticists. \n\n> \u201cWe were asked to take our biomedical expertise and do research on the hospital. . . . Hospitals are trying pilots all the time. Making sure these pilots are evaluated in a rigorous way is what we\u2019re working on. That\u2019s really exciting to me.\u201d\n\nRimma enjoyes working as part of a diverse, collaborative team in solving important, complex problems that make a meaningful difference in patients\u2019 lives and in healthcare. She also loves that her skills as an informaticist are valued by her clinical colleaugues and that her work is helping doctors and patients.\n\nIn addition, Rimma is part of the faculty at Columbia\u2019s Biomedical Informatics Department. She teaches a practical class to future informaticians about what really happens in hospitals. Classes include discussions about how hospitals really operate, about the patient experience, and about physicians\u2019 needs at the point of care. This is real-world information she felt was lacking from biomedical informatics programs. \n\nAs the amount of data continues to grow, the field of biomedical informatics will continue to grow. Rimma sees this as a tremendously exciting time to be in this space.\n\n> \u201cWe\u2019ve been saying for years, \u2018This is the right time for biomedical informatics.\u2019 And it\u2019s still the right time for biomedical informatics. We have so many problems in healthcare that we haven\u2019t fixed. Come help us.\u201d\n\n",csTitle:"Rimma Perotte, PhD, Program Director for Research Science, Value Institute, New York-Presbyterian Hospital",csYt:"gyZhXJ7gMm4"},{name:"Sharon Chiang",img:i.p+"static/media/Sharon Chiang.9b3eec13.jpg",title:"MD, PhD",csBody:"\n<hl>Sharon Chiang is \u201cphysician scientist\u201d with an MD and a PhD in statistics. She is currently working on her residency in neurology and conducting research on epilepsy.  <hl>\n\n## Multiple Interests and Options\n\nGrowing up in Claremont, California, Sharon Chiang had many interests. She was interested in hiking and liked rocks, which led her to thinking about becoming a geologist. She also liked math, enjoyed finding patterns in data, and thought about becoming a statistician. And, she saw the relationship that her father, a physician, had with his patients, and thought about becoming a physician.\n\nIn deciding where to go to college, Sharon was accepted into a unique eight-year program at Rice University. This program combines a four-year bachelor\u2019s degree with four years of medical school at Baylor College of Medicine. Students spend their first four years as undergrads at Rice, where they are encouraged to pursue broad interests. They then go on to medical school.\n\nSharon followed this encouragement and took classes outside of the traditional pre-med track, in areas such as economics and statistics. Through her interest in microeconomics, she had an internship as a case manager at a homeless shelter. She designed a program to model homelessness and assess the factors to predict why some people are able to exit homelessness while others are not.\n\nHer interest in statistics led Sharon to take an introductory stats course followed by classes in data mining, machine learning, and Bayesian modeling. She liked statistics so much that this became her major.\n\nAs was her plan, upon completing her undergraduate studies, Sharon proceeded on to medical school. In her first year of medical school, while shadowing a physician, she saw an epileptic patient have an unexpected seizure. This experience heightened Sharon\u2019s interest in specializing in neurology and also spurred her curiousity to use data and statistical models to better understand and predict seizures.\n\nAfter Sharon\u2019s second year of medical school, she decided to embark on an unconventional path. She took a break from medical school to get her PhD in statistics, as she wanted to strengthen her skills in developing statistical models and conducting research. She then returned to medical school to complete her MD, as she could not see herself not being a physician.\n\nThe result: a unique combination of an MD and a PhD in statistics. This path was encouraged by mentors who advised Sharon, \u201cYou can do both.\u201d\n\n## The Path of a Physician Scientist\n\nSharon is currently in the middle of her residency in neurology at the University of California, San Francisco. Ideally, after she completes her residency she will spend approximately 10% of her time as a clinician, treating patients, and 80-90% of her time conducting research.\n\n> \u201cI think seeing patients every day and helping them get better is rewarding. . . . Then, being able to model those phenomena that we see clinically and translate that into improvements in patient outcomes, I think is probably one of the most rewarding things.\u201d\n\nHer research to date has focused on the unpredictability of seizures among patients with epilepsy. By gathering real-time data using biosensors, Sharon is working to develop models that can predict seizures, assist patients, and produce a measurable improvement in patients\u2019 quality of life.\n\nWhile her path is somewhat unconventional, as the amount of technology and data explodes, Sharon believes there will be more physician scientists who combine the clinical knowledge of a physician with the skills of a statistician, computer scientist, or biomedical informaticist. \n\nShe advises today\u2019s students to accumulate as many skills as possible in areas such as computer science, statistics, information technology, and biomedical informatics. Also, get involved with a project and start working with data. These skills and experiences will create amazing career opportunities.\n\n> \u201cMy goal is to develop a career as a physician scientist. I would like to continue statistical modeling and continue in the field of biomedical informatics. I want to continue with the application of statistics to address issues that people with epilepsy and other neurological disorders face.\u201d\n\nTo date, Sharon\u2019s focus has largely been on neurology, and specifically on epilepsy. But she sees the skills she has gained as generalizable in harnessing the massive amounts of data being generated from different sources to improve human health. She sees biomedical informatics as essential to that process.\n\n",csTitle:"Sharon Chiang, MD, PhD, Resident Physician, University of California",csYt:"yZA5Fbo56SQ"},{name:"Siddharth Pratap",img:i.p+"static/media/Siddharth Pratap.37599e92.jpg",title:"PhD",csBody:"\n<hl>Siddharth Pratap (Sidd) got his PhD in microbiology and then did a postdoc and a master\u2019s degree in biomedical informatics. He is an associate professor at Meharry Medical College where he is building a core lab, conducting research on areas such as the human genome, and teaching biomedical informatics.</hl>\n\n## Engineering, Biology, Informatics\n\nAs a kid growing up in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, Sidd Pratap was a self-proclaimed math and science geek who was always taking things apart and putting them back together. He was inspired by his father, a mechanical engineer. Sidd also collected comic books. In contemplating a possible career, Sidd saw himself as an inventor or a builder.\n\nSidd started college studying to become an electrical engineer\u2014until he took his first biology class. Inspired by an amazing teacher, Sidd decided he wanted to study biology and be a teacher. He ended up majoring in microbiology at Indiana University and took part in research at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI). This was a formative experience as Sidd got to spend time in a lab and learned to write grant applications.\n\nDuring college Sidd had internships that allowed him to explore different possibilities. One was at a pharmaceutical company. Another involved an engineering project related to a drug delivery device, exposing him to biotech R&D. Also occurring during this time was the advancement of the Human Genome Project, which presented the exciting possibility of sequencing the entire human genome. \n\nAmong all of the possibilities, Sidd was most interested in research. He decided to pursue his PhD in biomedical sciences, with a focus on microbiology, at Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tennessee. Sidd was attracted to Meharry by the presence of several microbiology labs focused on parasitology, infectious diseases, and tropical diseases. These labs provided the opportunity to collaborate with people with similar interests. \n\nSidd\u2019s PhD research was on Chagas disease, termed an orphan disease or a neglected tropical disease. About 300,000 people in the US have Chagas but it affects about eight million people in South America.   \n\nTowards the end of Sidd\u2019s PhD, he used a technology that enabled profiling thousands of genes at the same time. This was Sidd\u2019s first exposure to biomedical informatics, and it prompted him to want to learn more. He received advice to not just dabble in bioinformatics, but to do it with 100% of his time. At the time (around 2005), there were fewer than six postdoc programs in the country that combined research with a master\u2019s in biomedical informatics (MBI). One program was nearby at Vanderbilt. \n\nIn pursuing an MBI, Sidd saw himself as a bench scientist with knowledge of how a parasite infects cells. He wanted to broaden his knowledge to understand what happens in patients. He also wanted to improve his coding, gain skills related to working with massive amounts of data, and use computers to do biology. For his MBI thesis, Sidd looked at mutations in a human genome. \n\n> \u201cBeing able to combine what I learned from engineering and also from infectious disease bench research into this informatics approach to make something that I think we would have called systems biology . . . was definitely part of the growth for me and my career.\u201d\n\n## Building a Core Lab\n\nUpon compleing his MBI, Sidd had the desire to build something. He went back to Meharry to participate in building a core laboratory to sequence genomes of local patients. He also saw the opportunity to teach. His faculty appointment at Meharry allows him to conduct research, build the core lab, and teach biomedical informatics.  \n\n> \u201cI think the [MBI] degree was like an entry way.\u201d\n\nWorking in the core lab provides exposure to multiple projects. Sidd\u2019s bioinformatics expertise enables scaling projects to analyze huge amounts of data, and applying learning in humans entails becoming involved in large-scale clinical trials. Connecting these previously separate research flows is now termed \u201ctranslational medicine.\u201d The hope of translational medicine is to create useful products much faster than in the past, which Sidd sees as rewarding.\n\nSidd loves getting to use smart tools desired by smart people, enjoys collaborating with others who have similar research interests, and likes seeing the results from research translated into real-world solutions. He views informatics as providing the ability to answering old questions much faster.\n\nWhile at Meharry, Sidd has also been involved in the Meharry Rise Initiative, which is geared to educating and training minorities in the biomedical sciences and get more underrepresented minorities into research. As part of the Rise Initiative, biomedical informatics is being built into the curriculum for all Meharry students to enhance students\u2019 ability to conduct research. \n\n> \u201cIncorporating informatics lets us answer the same questions we had before but with such a wide array of approaches that you get a much more complete picture of what\u2019s going on at the cellular level or patient level. That\u2019s how it benefits my research, but its true for anyone applying these techniques.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n",csTitle:"Siddharth Pratap, PhD, MS, Associate Professor, Meharry Medical College",csYt:"NnymY5QCtM0"},{name:"Zachary Lipton",img:i.p+"static/media/Zachary Lipton.eee36148.jpg",title:"PhD",csBody:"\n<hl>After years as a jazz musician, Zack Lipton became fascinated by using machine learning to solve problems that matter, particularly in healthcare. He got his PhD and is an assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon University.</hl>\n\n## From Jam Sessions to a PhD\n\nZack Lipton always wanted to be a musician, and for a period of time he was. He took saxophone lessons from Branford Marsalis while in high school and proceeded to Columbia University where he studied math and economics during the day and participated in jazz jam sessions throughout New York City most nights. After graduating, Zack stayed in New York City and pursued his passion for music. \n\nOn the side, Zack dabbled in computer science and learned enough web programming to build websites and make a few dollars. Through contacts, Zack was introduced to and built websites for professors and a PI. While he had no background in computer science or medical research, he was attracted to the open, inquisitive culture in these researchers\u2019 labs. While building their websites he started hanging out in this environment, reading, and attending discussions. He found the experience stimulating.\n\nAt some point Zack visited a friend who was getting a PhD at the Universty of California Santa Cruz, which Zack described as \u201cthe most beautiful place in the history of the world.\u201d Having spent years as a jazz musician in New York City hemorrhaging money, Zack decided that he too wanted to move to California to pursue a PhD (He had other friends who had also gone the PhD route and thought it would be a good fit for him.)\n\nAfter deciding to move to California to get a PhD, Zack had to decide what field to focus on. At the time he had never heard of biomedical informatics, but was interested in life sciences and working on healthcare problems. He also knew he wanted to acquire skills in computer science, probability and statistics, and machine learning. He concluded he wanted to do a PhD in computer science with a focus on machine learning.\n\n> \u201cI settled on applying to computer science and decided to learn machine learning and use it to do something useful for medical care.\u201d\n\nZack moved to California and undertook applying to PhD programs. While completing his applications he spent time working to become a better programmer. He ultimately was accepted and chose to attend the University of San Diego.\n\n## From Saxophonist to Professor?\n\nIn retrospect, Zack says he was incredibly na\xefve about making the jump from music to a computer science PhD program. However, at times detailed plans and formal qualifications are less important than interest, curiousity, hard work, and good fortune.\n\nHe was fortunate to get taken under the wing of faculty members who served as advisors and mentors. He was also lucky that early in his PhD he identified a problem to research that others had overlooked. This research led to Zack getting a paper published in just a few months.\n\nSuddenly it seemed the ridiculous idea of becoming a professor was no longer so ridiculous. He found the academic environment appealed to him in that it provided a mandate to work on interesting problems, with autonomy and flexibility.\n\n> \u201cI went from being really unfocused, having no plans out more than maybe one year, to being in a PhD program and having this ridiculous idea of \u2018I\u2019m going to be a faculty member.\u2019\u201d\n\nZack found research exciting and addictive. The culture of research is figuring out what other people are missing, deciding what problems to explore, and then researching these questions.\n\nWhile Zack was working on his PhD, breakthroughs were taking place in machine learning and natural language processing, as people figured out how to train massive neural networks and deep learning emerged. It was an exciting time.\n\nZack was subsequently invited to inverview for a faculty position at Carnegie Mellon, which happened sooner than he thought. He got the position, which is a joint appointment in the school of business and the machine learning department. Zack loves the freedom and autonomy of deciding research questions to focus on. He finds the academic environment and the interaction with amazing students exhilerating.\n\nIn addition, one of his focus areas is using his knowledge and tools to work on meaningful problems in the world of healthcare, which are some of the most important problems in society. These problems are a place where machine learning can make a meaningful difference. \n\n> \u201cThe cool thing about working in the medical informatics space is that the problems actually matter.\u201d\n",csTitle:"Zachary Lipton, PhD, Staff Scientist, Assistant Professor, Carnegie Mellon University",csYt:"viT61nG_f6g"},{name:"Zhiyong Lu",img:i.p+"static/media/Zhiyong Lu.b243cc18.jpg",title:"PhD",csBody:"\n<hl>Zhiyong Lu is a researcher at the government-run National Center for Biotechnology where he uses knowledge of natural language processing and AI to create applications used by millions of people worldwide. </hl>\n\n## Applying Computers to Biology\n\nZhiyong Lu grew up in an ancient city in China outside of Shanghai. Because he was good at math and the STEM subjects, a high school teacher encouraged Zhiyong to study computer science in college, which he did. Zhiyong attended Nanjing University, one of China\u2019s top schools. In addition to computer science, he also studied English to prepare for graduate school in North America.\n\nChoosing to continue studying computer science, Zhiyong matriculated to the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada to pursue a master\u2019s degree. The University of Alberta was regarded as having a great computer science program and excelled in artificial intelligence, which was of interest to Zhiyong.\n\nWhile working on his master\u2019s, a computer science progressor suggested that Zhiyong consider focusing on a bioinformatics project for his thesis. This was Zhiyong\u2019s first exposure to the field of bioinformatics and to the idea that computers could be used to solve biology problems. He ended up doing his thesis on using machine learning to do sub-cellular localization prediction.\n\n> \u201cI had never thought about applying computers to biology . . . I found it fascinating that you can use computer science to solve a biology or medicine problem.\u201d\n\nZhiyong\u2019s interest in the intersection of computer science and biology led him to attend two bioinformatics conferences, which only deepened his curiousity. He made contacts in the field and decided to pursue a PhD in bioinformatics at the University of Colorado School of Medicine.\n\n## Becoming a Researcher\n\nIn working toward his PhD, Zhiyong took several courses in biology, which he hadn\u2019t studied since high school and which proved challenging. He also took courses in natural language processing and AI, which have since become his research focus. \n\nEarly on in the PhD program, Zhiyong saw himself on the path of probably becoming a professor. But through the rigor of the program at the University of Colorado, he saw himself turn into a researcher and an independent scientist. Over a roughly five-year period, Zhiyong matured as a researcher, learned about writing and publishing, and got exposure to reviewing papers and writing grants.\n\n> \u201c[The PhD program at the University of Colorado] turned me from a very good student and prepared me to be a researcher, to be an independent scientist.\u201d\n\nIt turned out that as part of Zhiyong\u2019s PhD thesis he was doing a great deal of work with data coming from the National Library of Medicine (NLM). This exposed him to NLM and caused others to joke with him that due to all of the data he was accessing from the NLM, perhaps the NLM would hire him. Little did they know that this would prove to be true, though Zhiyong says this particular project was not the reason he was hired by NLM. \n\nZhiyong joined the National Center for Biotechnology (NCBI), which is part of NLM, in 2007. He uses natural language processing and text mining to do biomedical literature mining. He is constantly engaging in interesting research and is also creating and improving real-world applications. An example is using natural language processing to make PubMed\u2014a research tool used by 2.5 million people worldwide\u2014even more effective.\n\n> \u201cI think research is fun. Research is really exciting. And on top of that, if I can apply my research into real-world applications and make some real-world effect, I can have an impact on end users. That\u2019s extremely rewarding.\u201d\n\nThese days, Zhiyong is branching out by engaging in some medical image analysis. Specifically, he is working on deep learning and machine learning algorithms that take retinal images of people\u2019s eyes and do a better job than doctors at diagnosing and predicting macular degeneration. \n\nWhether a person is working in industry, academia, or government (as Zhiyong does), he sees it as a tremendously exciting time for the field of biomedical informatics. \n\n \n\n\n",csTitle:"Zhiyong Lu, PhD, Deputy Director for Literature Search at the National Center for Biotechnology (NCBI)",csYt:"NXt6qKuG0HY"}],r=i(106),h=i.n(r),c=i(107),l=i.n(c),d=i(108),m=i.n(d),p=i.p+"static/media/home.5dd0ac3f.png",g=i(109),u=(i(275),i(1));var f=function(e){g.parse(e.location.search,{ignoreQueryPrefix:!0});var a=e.location.pathname,i=s.map((function(e,a){return"/".concat(a+1)})),t=["/home","/participants","/about"].concat(i),n=a&&t.find((function(e){return e===a}))?a:t[0],r=function(e){return e.name+(e.title?", ".concat(e.title):"")};return console.log(e.location,a),Object(u.jsxs)("div",{className:"app",children:[Object(u.jsxs)("div",{className:"header",children:[Object(u.jsx)("span",{className:"title",onClick:function(){return window.open(o.homepage,"_self")},children:"Connections\xa0"}),Object(u.jsx)("span",{className:"subtitle",children:"\xa0Career Paths in Biomedical Informatics"}),Object(u.jsxs)("nav",{className:"nav",children:[Object(u.jsx)("span",{className:"nav-link",onClick:function(){return window.open(o.homepage+"#/home","_self")},children:"Home"}),Object(u.jsx)("span",{className:"nav-link",onClick:function(){return window.open(o.homepage+"#/participants","_self")},children:"Participants"}),Object(u.jsx)("span",{className:"nav-link",onClick:function(){return window.open(o.homepage+"#/about","_self")},children:"About"})]})]}),Object(u.jsxs)("div",{className:"body",children:["/home"===n?Object(u.jsxs)("div",{className:"home",children:[Object(u.jsx)("img",{className:"home-img",src:p}),Object(u.jsxs)("p",{className:"home-text",children:["(placeholder) Trainees from across the 16 National of Library of Medicine (NLM) university-based Biomedical Informatics and Data Science Research Trainees programs will be featured in 16-part video series titled Connections: Career Paths in Biomedical Informatics.
